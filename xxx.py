I have that data. I created a survey. Each arrticle is represnted by one picture. I asked users as 2 pictures in one pair, asking which one is more realistic. I have the ELO values of the images. I will cluster them later with the appropriate k-mean. 

Afterwards, I want to see if is there any realiton between cluster and the all other features of the data such as =
study_focus,historical_site_type,historical_site_type_sub,platform,device,technique,technique_sub,software_data,software_modeling,software_render

So, I will do supervised machine learning using clusters, I will see with different machine learning models=
models = [
    ('Naive Bayes (Gaussian)',                   GaussianNB()),
    ('Logistic Regression (ridge)',              LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000, random_state=42)),
    ('Deep Neural Network (two hidden layers)',  MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(64,32), max_iter=500, random_state=42)),
    ('Decision Tree (CART)',                     DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)),
    ('Random Forest (100 trees)',                RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)),
    ('Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)',      SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=42)),
    ('k-Nearest Neighbors',                      KNeighborsClassifier()),
]



But I am not sure how to modify and manipluate the data. Fİrst I have done that =
id,order,year,country,study_focus,historical_site_type,historical_site_type_sub,platform_vr,platform_ar,platform_mr,platform_xr,device_hmd,device_pc,device_mobile,device_immersive_display,tech_3d_scanning,tech_image_based_techniques,tech_geospatial_techniques,tech_modeling,tech_data_processing,software_data,software_modeling,software_render
